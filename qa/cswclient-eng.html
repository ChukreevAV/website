<p>CSW (Catalogue Service for Web) is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)
specification, that defines common interfaces to discover, browse, and
query metadata about data, services, and other potential resources.</p>

<p>CSWclient plugin for QGIS provides userfriendly interface for this services.</p>
<p>Development of CSWclient was sponsored by Linifiniti Consulting.</p>

<h2><strong><a name="01" id="01"></a></strong>1. Installation notes</h2>
<p>Plugin is available via GIS-Lab <a href="/programs/qgis/qgis-repo.xml">repository</a>.</p>
<p>CSWClient is designed for QGIS version 1.5.0 and higher. There are no
dependencies, all necessary files (owslib) are included in package.</p>

<p>After plugin installation and startup by clicking
<img src="/images/cswclient-01.png" alt="Plugin button" width="32" height="32"></img>
main window with two tabs will appear.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cswclient-eng-02.png" alt="Main plugin window (Servers tab)" width="742" height="460"></img></p>
<h3><img src="/images/cswclient-eng-03.png" alt="Main plugin window (Search tab)" width="742" height="460">Server list management </h3>
<p>The &laquo;Servers&raquo; tab is used for managing the list of available
  servers. Plugin is shipped with small default list of servers, which you can add by
  pressing &laquo;Add default servers&raquo; button. You can also add new
  servers, edit or delete existing ones with &laquo;New&raquo;, &laquo;Edit&raquo;
  and &laquo;Delete&raquo; buttons respectively.</p>
<p>Besides this it is possible to share your list of servers with others by saving server list in file with &laquo;Save&raquo;
button and load them from file with &laquo;Load&raquo; button. Before saving
or loading you can select whichever servers you'd like to share. This is useful when you need
to share settings between  computers and people.</p>

<p>&laquo;Server info&raquo; will display available information about server
in the text area. Button &laquo;Metadata&raquo; has same purpose, but displayed
information in separate window as XML document.</p>

<h3>Searching for data </h3>
<p>&laquo;Search&raquo; tab has everything you need to set up search parameters and
  view results.</p>
<p>First of all you need to enter search keyword (or comma separated
list of keywords) and geographic boundaries to search in. By default, canvas bounding
box is used. If necessary, you can enter values in fields manually. &laquo;From map canvas&raquo;
and &laquo;Set global&raquo; buttons allow to set up canvas bbox and global
bbox in one click.</p>

<p>Results are displayed in list. It is possible to sort them by clicking
on column title. When record is selected &laquo;Abstract&raquo; field is
filled, and if available dataset URL is displayed. &laquo;Metadata&raquo; button
 also becomes active. Pressing on this button will display record metadata.
When &laquo;Show XML&raquo; is clicked  a window will appear with server
response in XML format.</p>

<p>You can navigate through search results with &laquo;First&raquo;,
&laquo;Last&raquo;, &laquo;Next&raquo; and &laquo;Prev&raquo; buttons.</p>
<h3>Accessing data </h3>
<p>If record has type &laquo;downloadableData&raquo; and there is a link
in their metadata, button &laquo;Open URL&raquo; will be active. Pressing
this button will  open the link in the default browser.</p>

<p>If record has type &laquo;liveData&raquo; and there is a link in their
metadata, &laquo;Add to WMS list&raquo; button will be enabled. When this
button is pressed plugin will try to verify if this WMS server is valid. On success you will be asked for name for this server and it will be
added to the QGIS WMS servers list. You can connect for this server
as usual using Layer\Add WMS layer.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>. Current test for WMS URL's
validity is very simple. So in some cases this test will return wrong results and server
will not be added to the QGIS WMS list. In this case you can copy URL and
add it manually. We'd also welcome report on that.</p>
