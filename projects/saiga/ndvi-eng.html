                  <p class="text">  <em>Megaloceros giganteus</em> or Megaceros, is an extinct deer that lived in Eurasia, from Ireland to China, during the Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene epochs. It is famous for its formidable size (about two meters (6?') at the shoulders), and in particular for having the largest antlers of any known cervid (a maximum of 13 feet or 4 meters from tip to tip).  </p>
                  <p class="text">The size of the Irish Elk's antlers is remarkable and they do seem to have played a role in the animal's eventual extinction. Recent research has determined that due to the high amounts of calcium and phosphate compounds required to form these massive structures, the Irish Elk males had to deplete these compounds partly from their bones, replenishing them from foodplants when the antlers were grown. Thus, in the growth phase, males were suffering from a condition similar to osteoporosis. When the climate changed at the end of the last Ice Age, the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals. Thus, the delicate balance between the animal and its environment was broken, the probable cause of this animal's extinction. Some have suggested hunting by man is a contributing factor in the demise of Megaloceros giganteus, but most paleontologists now believe that the last animal died off about 10,600 years ago, over a millennium before the first humans arrived. </p>

                  <p class="text">This example shows, that the surroundings are sometimes of critical importance to welfare of animals and that the sizes of animal dimensions are related to the environment. Is there a connection between body size (allometric parameters) and the surroundings it lives? Can the amount of green biomass in the landscapes be related to average body size?</p>
                  <p class="text"><img src="/images/3.gif" alt="3" width="33" height="41" align="left">	<a name="3"></a> <strong>Methodology</strong></p>
                  <p class="text">To answer these questions, or at least generate some potential reasons for deviations in the body mass, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used as a convenient source of data about status and biomass of vegetation in the animals home range.</p>
                  <p class="text">NDVI calculation is based on this formula: 
  &nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="center" class="text"><img src="/images/saiga-ndvi-02.gif"></p>
                  <p align="left" class="text">And it reflects the generic vegetation reflectance curve, which most of the vegetation types follow. Using differences in Red and Near-Infrared bands of the sensor vegetation and its status can be easily distinguished from other objects.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p align="left" class="text"> To use NDVI for the specific area, we need to sum all the values of it in this area during the year. This index is called cumulative NDVI and has been shown in recent studies to correlate well with seasonal changes in vegetation and its biomass and condition. I.e. bigger values of cumulative NDVI show healthier and more productive communities of the same or different ecosystems.</p>

Study of vegetation productivity shows also, that previous lambing grounds were more productive in terms of vegetation than current ones and this definitely is not good for overall population performance (Fig. 10).&nbsp;</p>

                  <p class="text">NDVI gives important tool for quantitative assessment of vegetation parameters. The results mentioned above shows, that this areas have distinctive difference in phenology and productivity in vegetation. These differences are well related to the ecology of the species, migratory Kazakhstan population uses study site only in the summer and this is supported by big cumulative NDVI values in this period, and Russian population while not really migratory have more vegetation resources in their disposal in general.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Recent trends in range contractions of Russian population show overall decrease in productivity of the sites, i.e. Saiga is pushed toward less productive pastures. This and previous conclusion can be used as a indicator of high difference between environment in which populations are situated and potential reason for difference in body mass. While more direct comparison of body mass/productivity should be carried out to prove this hypothesis.                  </p>
                  <p class="text">From the point of view of software, neither of the off-the-shelf packages aimed to work with raster data, are not ready to work with such huge datasets without considerable amount of additional scripting/programming. Created software can be easily reused for future research.                    </p>

                  <p class="text">Carried analysis proved to be good for pastures comparisons and more ideas can be explored using this methodology.</p>
                  <p class="text">These experiments can include:</p>
                  <p class="text"> 1.	Verify the performance of MODIS NDVI versus other NDVI products.                  </p>
                  <p class="text">2.	Compare performance of NDVI with EVI indexes.</p>
                  <p class="text"> 3.	Correlate NDVI data with body mass differences over the year for different sites                  </p>
                  <p class="text">4.	Correlate NDVI data with body mass for different years for the same site.
