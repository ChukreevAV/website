            <p><strong>*=== INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
            <p>The Society for Conservation GIS (SCGIS - <a href="http://www.scgis.org/" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.scgis.org</a>)  Global Scholarship Program is not a typical scholarship program.  Rather, it is a support program that covers  SOME of the costs to allow you attend 2 of the best Conservation GIS  conferences in the world, ESRI and SCGIS, and join in a very tight-knit community  of comrades in specialized 2-week training courses before these  conferences.  Local travel and accommodations  will be simple and plain so that we can afford to include as many people as  possible, and you may be asked to pay for some of these costs.  These support grants are PARTIAL in that you  contribute some of the costs yourself and you will be expected to do a lot of  work as a scholar.  These grants are  competitive in that your application will be considered in comparison to around  200 others, evaluating your work, your activism with NGO's, your needs, and  your resources in relation to the environmental and economic issues of your  region or country.  These grants may or  may not also include software, books, and refurbished hardware, depending on  your needs.  We are generally able to  award enough support so that 30 scholars or more are able to attend, out of the  200 that apply, so if you are willing to study these guidelines and work hard,  your chances of selection are good.</p>
            <p>The group of SCGIS scholarship awardees will attend two conferences: the  27th ESRI International User Conference held on June 18-22 in San Diego, CA, and the 10th SCGIS  Annual Conference, held on June 25-28 in Monterey, CA. </p>
            <p>The ESRI UC is the largest GIS event in the world. Last year’s  conference brought together over 14,000 attendees from all over the world,  providing an opportunity for GIS practitioners of all levels and backgrounds to  meet, network, and learn about the most recent developments in GIS technology.  The Conservation track at the conference is getting bigger each year,  attracting many conservation GIS practitioners. The SCGIS Annual Conference is  attended by approximately 200 conservation GIS practitioners, providing a  convenient venue for the attendees to meet and discuss GIS application in the  field of conservation.</p>
            <p>During the two weeks preceding the conferences (June 4-15) SCGIS  scholars will be offered GIS courses, which will be focused on the ESRI suite  of GIS software, and will be taught by ESRI certified instructors. The training  will be held in Redlands, CA, and at the  James Reserve, a biological station run by the University of California. We will also  try to organize workshops on application of advanced GIS analysis in  conservation projects. Please carefully read details about the training below  in the GIS courses section.</p>
            <p>(SCGIS is an independent  all-volunteer international society supported by membership donations and  grants from ESRI, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Garmin International,  US Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the University of California James Reserve)</p>
            <p><strong><a name="require" id="require"></a>*=== REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
            <p>Scholarship application requirements are as follows:</p>
            <p>1) Applicants must be affiliated with a NON-PROFIT CONSERVATION  ORGANIZATION or a UNIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT in their region or country.</p>
            <p>2) SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS:<br />
              a) COMPLETED APPLICATION  FORM (see below).</p>
            <p>          b) AN ABSTRACT OF YOUR  PROPOSED PRESENTATION should be included in a special section of the  application (see below).</p>
            <p>          c) A COVER LETTER from the HEAD of your  Organization  detailing the national or  international conservation organization's focus and current projects; the  applicant's role in the organization and current projects must be defined. The  NAME and DIRECT/PERSONAL E-MAIL ADDRESS of the HEAD of your organization should  be clearly stated in the letter.</p>
            <p>          d) AN EXAMPLE OF YOUR CONSERVATION  GIS OR MAPPING WORK which may include map screenshots, database structure  description, or other mapping or GIS related works that YOU created.</p>
            <p>3) CLOSING DATE for SCGIS conference scholarship applications is January  31st, 2007. Applications ONLY VIA E-MAIL must be received by the above date.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== ELIGIBILITY</strong></p>
            <p>Grants are made on a competitive basis to individuals working with GIS  in conservation science and action. Preference goes to those who are working  for or associated with a non-profit or non-government organization, whose GIS  research serves as basis for conservation action, who can show some ability to  find local funding for their work, and who show an ability to teach about  conservation GIS to other non-profit organizations in their region or country.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, under the current U.S. export  regulations for sensitive software (which includes GIS technology), we are not  allowed to accept applications from residents of North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Sudan.</p>
            <p>Applicants who have received a SCGIS scholarship award in the past are  eligible to apply again, but not earlier than two years after their prior  award. I.e., we will not accept applications from the Scholars 2006, but any  earlier scholar is eligible to apply. However, the priority will be reserved  for first time applicants. Returning scholars, please carefully read special  instructions below.</p>
            <p>If you were awarded a SCGIS scholarship in the past, but for some reason  were unable to attend the program, you have to apply again this year if you  want a scholarship. We currently don’t roll over earlier awards to the following  year. Your prior effort and acceptance will be taken into consideration,  however your new application will be in competition with an entirely new group  so you may receive a different score this time.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== YOUR OBLIGATIONS IF SELECTED AS  A SCHOLAR</strong></p>
            <p>Scholarship awardees will be required to do all of the following:<br />
              <br />
              a)    present  a talk and a poster describing their conservation efforts and projects within  their organization at the SCGIS conference and the Conservation Hall at the  ESRI User Conference.</p>
            <p>        b)   be available to volunteer to help with the  SCGIS conference and the Conservation Hall at the ESRI User Conference. We  expect recipients to volunteer for approximately 4 hours over the course of the  conference.  Some work may take place  during sessions, but adjustments can be made to ensure that volunteers attend  the sessions that are most important to them.   Details for volunteers will be provided shortly before the conference.</p>
            <p>        c)   attend the training classes  you are assigned to.  Once accepted, you  are expected to attend all of the courses to which you will be assigned. We  will work with each of you individually to customize a training course schedule  to fit your needs.  </p>
            <p>        d)   participate in scholarship  support activities outside of weekday classes, according to your skills and  interests, such as hardware assistance, web research or field trips.</p>
            <p>        e)   complete and submit 2  reports:<br />
              1.   Scholar's report is an informal account of  your experiences as a scholar and is due towards the end of your travels.<br />
              2.  Scholarship Final report is a formal account  of your work back home and is due several months after you return home.  It describes how you have applied the  training, software and other items of your grant, with example maps and photos,  and specific suggestions and criticisms for improving the program.  Specific requirements and due dates are  finalized later.</p>
            <p>        f)   read and respond quickly to  many emails.  There will be at least 20-25  emails from us with important announcements that you are required to read and  respond to.  Failure to do so in a prompt  manner can result in the disruption or even loss of portions of your grant.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== SCGIS  OBLIGATIONS TO YOU IF SELECTED AS A SCHOLAR</strong></p>
            <p>        You will  receive a combination of fee waivers, travel expenses and in-kind grants that  can be worth over $10,000. The specific components of this grant are:</p>
            <p>        a)  Tuition fees for GIS training (retail $450 per person per day) are FULLY paid  for</p>
            <p>        b)  Attendance fees for the ESRI User Conference ($1,250) and for SCGIS Annual  Conference ($100) are FULLY covered</p>
            <p>        c)  Travel expenses are PARTIALLY covered, depending on your grant level, beginning  when you leave to attend the program and ending when you return home from the  program, including the following categories of costs: Lodging, Food, Air and Ground  Transport. Each grantee's allocation will be different and many factors will go  into determining the grant for each scholar.</p>
            <p>        d)  Travel preparation expenses are NOT covered, including fees or travel expenses  you must pay locally to obtain Visas or pick up air tickets. </p>
            <p>        e)  Software and Textbooks grant:  As a  scholar you will be allowed to apply for a customized grant of software and  textbooks through a separate application process. You will receive details  about this if you are selected.</p>
            <p>        f)  Hardware grant: As a scholar you may have access to limited donations of older  used laptops from ESRI, GPS units, external drives, etc.  These may be free or much reduced in price.  Your eligibility for these will depend on  hardware availability, your work as a scholar and your prompt responses to  several hardware prioritization surveys, beginning with the  &quot;*-What GIS hardware do you most  critically need &quot; question in this application form.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== GENERAL APPLICATION  INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
            <p>Please review above the list of materials that are expected from you. Of  course, properly and thoughtfully submitted application form is the essential part  of the list, but the other parts are also important! Applications submitted  without the other required materials may be rejected, or will stand a much  lower chance of award.</p>
            <p>Before filling out the application form, please read the  section-by-section instructions below, and think carefully about the overall  structure of your application. </p>
            <p>Although the SCGIS Scholarship Program is not a typical scholarship  program, some general guidelines found at <a href="http://www.scholarshiphelp.org/preparing_application.htm" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.scholarshiphelp.org/preparing_application.htm</a> can help you in writing your application to SCGIS. The web site above is  designed primarily to help apply for college scholarships, so not everything on  that page is applicable to SCGIS Scholarship Program, however, there are a few  useful hints that will be helpful. The web site above is not affiliated with  SCGIS, and is provided as a resource that you can use at your own risk.</p>
            <p>Please DO NOT ERASE ANY OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE APPLICATION FORM. If a  question is not applicable to you, just leave the answer area blank.</p>
            <p>You will see that many sections are labeled in the instructions as ‘very  important’, and it’s true – we really need detailed and thoughtful answers to  most questions we are asking. The competition for SCGIS scholarships is very  tight, and if you limit your answers to short general phrases, this will reduce  your chances of winning a scholarship award.</p>
            <p>Please write your application in the English language. Although some of  our review committee members speak other languages, we’ll be able to judge your  application more fairly if it is written in English. Remember, if you are  awarded a scholarship you will join a group of people from all corners of the  world, and in such situations English is usually the common language. Also, the  training and conferences are all conducted in English, but technical GIS English  is less demanding and few of your colleagues will be fluent so your English  skills do not have to be brilliant and shiny. This is not our criteria,  so please do not be shy if your English is not perfect! You will find a way to  communicate with others!</p>
            <p>It is important for the applicants to make a very strong effort to  supply as much of their own funding for travel to the conference, as possible.  Preference will be given to those who make a sincere effort to obtain some of  their own funding.  Accordingly, the  applicant must supply information about additional funding they have been able  to or hope to secure.</p>
            <p>As indicated above, part of the application process is  your ability to pay some of the costs.    One of our rules for awarding grants is your ability to raise funds to  keep your own conservation GIS program alive.   Your ability to pay some of the costs is important. If you cannot pay  anything, you will need to provide strong evidence about the financial circumstances  of yourself, your institution, your country.   Each year we do indeed make some grants to scholars who are unable to  contribute anything, but the majority of the grants we make go to scholars who  are able to contribute an amount that is appropriate and sustainable given  their financial circumstances.  </p>
            <p>The important point is the amount you commit to  provide from your own resources will be examined carefully in relation to your  personal and institutional financial situation, your country, and the  importance of your work to conservation and society.  When you commit to an amount in your  application it is a serious commitment and if you are selected as a scholar we  expect you to honor that commitment to pay.   If you cannot, and you have not been in regular communication with us  about your circumstances, then parts of your grant will be declined, including  but not limited to hardware.</p>
            <p>If you have to use abbreviations in your application,  such as names of organizations or projects, please clearly decipher these abbreviations  before using them. Also, if you are referring to any local landmarks (a  mountain name, a region name, a park name etc.), please provide a brief  explanation of significance of such landmarks. Remember, your application will  be reviewed by experts working in many different parts of the world, and an abbreviation  or landmark that are a routine part of your daily work may not sound so  familiar to a person living on the other side of the globe!</p>

            </p>
            </p>
            <p>This information shall remain confidential and shall not be shared with  any third party.</p>
            <p><strong>[APPLICANT]<br />
              *-Your full name: <br />
              *-Your honorific (e.g. Mr., Ms., Dr.): <br />
              *-Your preferred informal name: <br />

		    </strong>
            <p>
            Please provide your personal information similarly to the organization  information. </p>
            <p>You can provide your full name to any extent that you find appropriate.  The format is completely flexible, and it does not have to be exactly ‘full’ in  official terms. Naming tradition diversity in the world is astonishing! The  order people use for family names and given names, the number of names, the  names pronunciation, the name that is actually used in the society to refer to  a person – all these can be different in different cultures on different  continents, and the diversity is not limited to this short list of examples.  SCGIS activists are constantly learning about these traditions from meeting  international scholars, however, there is always something new for us to learn!  Please be understanding if we misinterpret your name by accident – we do not  mean any offence! You can help us better understand you if you provide your  preferred “informal” name for cases where using full name is redundant. The  format for the “informal” name is completely open to your discretion. You may  leave this field blank if you want.</p>
            <p>For your interest keywords, please use the list of keywords above (see  ORGANIZATION section), plus any missing keywords that you would like to  include.</p>
            <p>This information may be shared to a third party only if we ask for and  receive your special permission.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Alternate contact full name:<br />
              *-Alternate honorific (i.e. Mr., Ms., Dr.):<br />
              *-Alternate contact direct phone number(s):<br />
              *-Alternate contact direct email address(es):<br />
            *-Alternate contact job title or role:</strong></p>
			  <p>
            Please provide contact details for an alternate contact person. We may  ask this person to convey important information to you when you are in the  field or out of contact for some other reason. These contact details will not  be used for any other purpose, and will not be shared with any third party.</p>
            <p><strong>[TRANSPORTATION]<br />
  *-Your departure airport to travel to the U.S.:</strong></p> 
            <p>Please let us  know what airport you will be flying from if you travel to California, USA (the FIRST airport  in your entire trip). This helps us better understand your actual travel needs.  If possible, please provide the 3-letter international code for your airport.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Total ROUNDTRIP airfare (in U.S. Dollars) to travel  to Los Angeles, CA  (LAX), or to Ontario, CA (ONT) in June:</strong></p>
            <p>Please research the round-trip airfares from your local airport to the  airports indicated in these two questions. Be aware that for the U.S. it is very  typical to have several airports in a big urban area such as Los    Angeles, that is why we are asking you to research different  options. Ontario (ONT) is the nearest large airport to Redlands, California, and will be  the most convenient to arrive to. However, ONT is not the largest airport in  the Redlands area, and  actually may not be available for international flights. If this is the case  with flights from your area, please research for airfares to Los    Angeles (LAX). Besides availability, airfares to the larger  LAX may be significantly cheaper than to smaller ONT, so please research all  possible options. Not only this will allow you to identify the most  cost-efficient way, but will also provide you with back-up options in case you  have to re-arrange your plans!</p>
            <p>International airfares are not cheap, but please research for reasonable  economy class options. SCGIS will not fund first-class or business-class  travel. Sometimes opting for a 1 stop or 2 stop flight might save you a  significant amount of money compared to a non-stop direct flight. On the other  hand, sometimes non-stop flights on a smaller national airline are cheaper than  1 or 2 stop flights on a major international carrier. Traveling on a weekday is  typically cheaper than traveling during weekend or holiday. So search  carefully! Besides the good old method of getting airfare quotes from a local  travel agent or an airline office, there are several online resources for  booking air tickets. We are listing some of these resources below, but PLEASE  NOTE THAT SCGIS IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THESE WEB-SITES OR COMPANIES IN ANY WAY.  THESE LINKS ARE PROVIDED FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE ONLY. SCGIS CAN’T BE MADE LIABLE  FOR ANY ISSUES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THESE SERVICES.</p>

            <p>Please provide all airfares for a ROUNDTRIP, and in the U.S. Dollars, not  in your local currency.</p>
            <p>If you have to bear significant costs for traveling to the nearest  airport, please indicate these costs separately in this section, too.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Airfare amount you can pay yourself (in U.S.  Dollars): <br />
            *-Airfare amount requested from SCGIS (in U.S.  Dollars):</strong></p>
            <p>              Typically we expect our applicants to cover a part of their travel  costs, through additional fundraising or other resources. In very rare cases we  provide a full airfare, but to be eligible you must provide a thorough  explanation in the justification section (below). We really appreciate every  effort you make to cover at least some portion of the costs. In these two  lines, please indicate (in U.S. Dollars) what part of the airfare costs you are  able to cover, and what part you would like SCGIS to cover.</p>
            <p><strong>[ACCOMMODATION]<br />
            *-Accommodation/Food/Local Transport costs that you  can pay (in U.S. Dollars):</strong></p>
            <p> If you are awarded a SCGIS scholarship, you will come to the U.S. for 4 weeks. Typically,  this may cost over $5,000. SCGIS volunteers work hard to reduce costs through  finding discounts, ride sharing, cooking options etc. This allows us to reduce  these per person costs to $2,000 on average. However, we greatly appreciate it  when scholars are able to raise funds to cover a portion of these costs. Please  indicate how much you can afford to pay for these expenses.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Will you share a private home? <br />
              *-Will you share a motel room?  <br />
              *-Will you camp? <br />
            *-Do you need to borrow camping equipment?</strong></p>
            <p> One of the ways for us to reduce lodging costs is to provide  accommodation at SCGIS activists’ homes, sharing hotel and dorm rooms, or  sometimes even tents where conditions permit. Please let us know your  accommodation preference/flexibility. If you can bring your own sleeping bag  and pad, please also indicate here.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Any special notes regarding Accommodation/Food/Local  Transport in California:</strong></p>
            <p> If you have any health or other conditions that require special food or  lodging please let us know. Also, please feel free to tell us anything  regarding local accommodation or food or transport arrangements in California that you think  we should know about.</p>
            <p><strong>[GIS EXPERTISE LEVEL / COURSES]<br />
            *-Briefly describe your GIS capability/expertise:</strong></p>
            <p>Please briefly  explain your GIS expertise / capability level - BEGINNER, MEDIUM or ADVANCED.  Please feel free to comment in open format.</p>
            <p>BEGINNER - Know about basic concepts of GIS and have used ArcExplorer,  web-based mapping resources, or similar level of GIS software.<br />
              MEDIUM - Know about the analysis concepts of GIS and have used ArcView  3x/9x or similar level of GIS software.<br />
              ADVANCED - Have been a GIS user for many years and have used ArcEditor  or ArcInfo or similar level of GIS software.</p>
            <p><strong>*-What GIS software (if any) have you used?:</strong></p>
            <p> Please provide details on what GIS software have you used, and briefly  describe operations that you have implemented in your GIS work.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Please describe your programming experience (if  any):</strong></p>
            <p> Please note that knowledge of programming is not necessary for using  GIS. However, today’s GIS software products allow users to extend the  functionality through writing scripts in programming languages such as Visual  Basic, Python, C++, etc. If you have any programming experience, please  mention, this will help us to better understand your level of skills.</p>
            <p><strong>*-What organization or individual helps you learn GIS  (your mentor)?<br />
              *-Your mentor’s email address: <br />
            *-Your mentor’s phone number:</strong></p>
            <p> Learning GIS is challenging! There are advanced international groups or  individuals who support developing grass-root organizations in building GIS  capacity through providing software, hardware, training, and general mentorship  until the GIS program reaches maturity in the organization. If you have such a  mentor, please give us their contact details. We may contact the mentor to  better learn about your GIS program. We will not use the contact information in  any other way.</p>
            <p><strong>*-What GIS courses are you interested in? (PLEASE SEE  INSTRUCTIONS!):<a name="courses" id="courses"></a></strong></p>
            <p>              This section is very important! Remember, the more thoughtful is your  approach in identifying your own training needs, the easier it is for your  application reviewers to understand you! </p>
            <p>The training courses that SCGIS arranges for scholars are generously  provided by ESRI. Every year we work hard to put together a training program  that benefits all our scholars, and to be successful in this we will need your  help! Please visit the page:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=search.results&amp;searchterm=&amp;softwaretype=All+Software&amp;trainingformat=2" target="_blank" class="external">http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=search.results&amp;searchterm=&amp;softwaretype=...</a></p>
            <p>and carefully read the description of each course (if the link above  changes, please visit the page <a href="http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.gateway" target="_blank" class="external">http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.gateway</a> , and search for Instructor&nbsp;Led  courses for All&nbsp;Software to  find the list of available courses and their description). In this section of  the application please list the courses that are most important for you, in the  order of decreasing priority. The final training program will be built based on  preferences we will receive from many scholars, and because it will be a  consensus of many needs we may not be able to offer your top priority course.  This may also happen if the instructor for the course you’re requesting is  unavailable at the time of SCGIS training. In the light of this, please provide  us with an EXTENDED list of your training priorities, so we know what course  you would prefer in case your top priorities are not available. Typically, the  SCGIS training program includes 3-4 courses; please provide 6-10 course titles  on your preferences list. We will make sure every scholar receives a solid and  appropriate training if we receive a meaningful listing of preferences from  you.</p>
            <p><strong>[HARDWARE REQUEST]<br />
              *-What GIS hardware do you most critically need  (please arrange list in order of priority)?:<br />

              PDA with moderate GPS sensitivity but capable to run  ArcPad<br />
              Desktop computer capable of GIS<br />
            Other (please describe)</strong></p>
            <p>Please arrange the hardware items on this list in the order of priority  for your GIS needs. Please feel free to erase any items that you do not need,  or to add any important items that are missing on the list.</p>
            <p>Please note that this is a survey question to help us with critical data  needed for our attempts to arrange hardware donations for 2007.  This is NOT a promise or indication that we  will be able to obtain or grant ANY of these items, but your thoughtful  responses indicating critical hardware needs and issues that you cannot resolve  locally are very important to us. Remember, you would have to carry back home  any hardware you receive from SCGIS.</p>
            <p><strong>[REQUIRED JUSTIFICATION (CONFIDENTIAL)]<br />
            *-Essay justification of why you require a grant:</strong></p>
            <p> This is a VERY IMPORTANT section! Please explain us why you would like  to join the SCGIS training and attend the conferences, and why you need a  scholarship grant for that. Justification cannot be as short as “I need to  improve my skills, and I can’t afford the trip”. We need to know in detail why  you need new contacts, new skills and so on, and a detailed justification why  you are asking for financial assistance.</p>
            <p><strong>[REQUIRED PAPER that you will present at the  conference]<br />
              *-Title of the paper you will present:<br />
            *-Abstract/summary of the paper you will present:</strong></p>
            <p> Please provide the information about the paper you will present if  awarded a scholarship.

If selected as a scholar, you  will be contacted by the papers coordinator for details about your paper (final  title and abstract text, full list of authors, etc.). </p>
            <p><strong>[REQUIRED BACKGROUND DATA]<a name="background" id="background"></a></strong></p>
            <p>              This is a VERY IMPORTANT section! In the following sub-sections, please  try to be as detailed as possible. Remember, we can only make an award decision  if we clearly understand the role that your organization and you play in the  field of conservation, and if we understand the role of the GIS component in  your work!</p>
            <p>In this section you might be using abbreviations and landmark names –  please remember to explain these carefully, as suggested in the General  Application Instructions.</p>
            <p><strong>*-HISTORY: Please describe the history of your local  work in conservation and GIS:</strong></p>
            <p> It’s important for us to know the history of your work – your personal  history of involvement in conservation, or your organization’s history and your  role in the organization’s projects.</p>
            <p>Please do not hesitate to explain how long you have been involved in  conservation and GIS, what projects or actions you have worked in, your  motivation for working in conservation, and anything else that you think is  relevant here.</p>
            <p><strong>*-LOCAL INVOLVEMENT:</strong></p>

Such cooperation may be in the form of  support coming from these groups, or in the form of involvement in  international conservation projects, networks etc. If applicable, please  provide full contact information for at least one person qualified to comment  on this work.</p>
            <p><strong>*-UNIQUE:   Please describe what is the most unique and the most challenging about  the conservation/GIS work that you do:</strong></p>
            <p> In this section, please tell us about the most exciting and the most  difficult parts of your work. You can tell us about the obstacles you’re having  in running your GIS projects. Also, please tell us anything you want about  uniqueness of the area where you work – remember, your reviewers may not be  aware about the beauty of the region you are from, and about the threats to  this region! </p>
            <p><strong>*-PLAN: Please provide a 1-year plan for how you hope  to apply the skills you will learn under the SCGIS scholarship, and what you  expect to be able to achieve in your conservation GIS work over the next year:</strong></p>
            <p> This is a very important part! Your plan for future work is the key for  application reviewers to know what outreach the SCGIS Scholarship Program may  expect, and what research or action the Scholarship Program is going to be  contributing to. You are not restricted to one year, please feel free to  provide a longer term plan if you can. </p>
            <p><strong>[RETURNING SCHOLAR STATUS REPORT]<br />
            *-RETURNING SCHOLARS: Please provide a report about  your progress and achievements since your last visit:</strong></p>
            <p> If you received the SCGIS Scholarship Award before, please fill in this  section, otherwise skip.<br />
              Our requirements to returning scholars are stricter compared to  first-time applicants. We need a strong justification to provide an award to  somebody who received it before. Please use this section to tell us about your  work since your last visit. While, of course, we would like to see certain  progress and achievements, please do not hesitate to tell us about difficulties  that may have prevented you from accomplishing something. We need to know about  your problems to understand your need for help! </p>
            <p>Please remember that the scholarship applications are reviewed by a panel  of reviewers, and even though you might have updated some members of the SCGIS  International Program, it is a good idea to use this section to provide a  detailed report for the reviewers who are not familiar with your work.</p>
