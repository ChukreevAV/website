<p><strong>Срок подачи заявок - 10 февраля 2011!</strong></p>
            <p><strong>*=== INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
            <p>The Society for Conservation GIS (SCGIS - <a href="http://www.scgis.org/">http://www.scgis.org</a>)  Global Scholarship Program is not a typical scholarship program.  Rather, it is a support program that covers  SOME of the costs to allow you attend 2 of the best Conservation GIS  conferences in the world, ESRI and SCGIS, and join in a very tight-knit community  of comrades in specialized 2-week training courses before these  conferences.  Local travel and accommodations  will be simple and plain so that we can afford to include as many people as  possible, and you may be asked to pay for some of these costs.  These support grants are PARTIAL in that you  contribute some of the costs yourself, and you will be expected to do a lot of  work as a scholar.  These grants are  competitive in that your application will be considered in comparison to others,  evaluating your work, your activism with NGO's and the conservation GIS  community in your region, your needs, and your resources in relation to the environmental  and economic issues of your region or country.   If our resources permit, these grants will also include software, books,  and refurbished hardware, depending on your needs.   Specific amounts of funding available for this  year’s program haven’t been clarified yet, therefore the number of people that  we will be able to award this time is not determined yet, but we expect that  there will be a strong competition between the applications regardless of the  program size decisions, so please study these guidelines and work hard to make  sure your chances of selection are good.</p>
            <p>The group of SCGIS scholarship awardees will attend two conferences: the  31st ESRI International User Conference held on July 11-15 in San   Diego, California, and the 14th  SCGIS Annual Conference, held on July 16-19 in Big Bear Lake, California.</p>
            <p>The ESRI UC is the largest GIS event in the world. Last year’s conference  brought together over 13,000 attendees from all over the world, providing an  opportunity for GIS practitioners of all levels and backgrounds to meet,  network, and learn about the most recent developments in GIS technology. The  Conservation track at the conference is getting bigger each year, attracting  many conservation GIS practitioners. The SCGIS Annual Conference is attended by  approximately 100–200 conservation GIS practitioners, providing a convenient  venue for the attendees to meet and discuss GIS application in the field of  conservation.</p>
            <p>During the two weeks preceding the conferences (June  27 – July 8) the scholars will be offered GIS training in Davis, California  that will focus on the ESRI suite of GIS software. The course modules will  cover material ranging from introductory to some advanced GIS analysis in  conservation applications, and will be taught by professional GIS instructors.  Besides course modules, the instructors will work with each scholar  individually on their specific GIS projects (please see details below in the  instructions).</p>
            <p><em>(SCGIS is an independent all-volunteer international society supported by membership donations and grants from ESRI, Garmin International, Juniper GIS, and University of California Davis)</em><em></em></p>
            <p><strong><a name="require" id="require"></a>*=== REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
            <p>Scholarship application requirements are as follows:</p>
            <p>1) Applicants must be affiliated with a NON-PROFIT CONSERVATION  ORGANIZATION or a UNIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT in their region or country, and involved in the SCGIS CHAPTER OR CONSERVATION  GIS COMMUNITY in their region.</p>
            <p>2) SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS:<br>
              a) COMPLETED APPLICATION  FORM (see below).</p>
            <p>          b) AN ABSTRACT OF YOUR  PROPOSED PRESENTATION should be included in a special section of the  application (see below).</p>
            <p>          c) AN EXAMPLE OF YOUR CONSERVATION  GIS OR MAPPING WORK which may include map screenshots, database structure  description, or other mapping or GIS related works that YOU created.</p>
            <p>3) CLOSING DATE for SCGIS scholarship applications is February 15, 2011.  Applications ONLY VIA E-MAIL must be received by the above date.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== ELIGIBILITY</strong></p>
            <p>Grants are made on a competitive basis to individuals  working with GIS in conservation science and action, and strongly involved with  their local conservation GIS community. Preference goes to those who are  working for or associated with a non-profit or non-government organization,  whose GIS research serves as basis for conservation action, who can show some  ability to find local funding for their work, and who show an ability to teach about  conservation GIS to other non-profit organizations in their region or country.</p>
            <p>If you were awarded a SCGIS scholarship in the past, but for some reason  were unable to attend the program, you have to apply again this year if you want  a scholarship. We currently don’t roll over earlier awards to the following  year. Your prior effort and acceptance will be taken into consideration,  however your new application will be in competition with an entirely new group  so you may receive a different score this time.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== YOUR OBLIGATIONS IF SELECTED AS  A SCHOLAR</strong></p>
            <p>Scholarship awardees will be required to do all of the following:<br>
 <br>
        a)    present  a talk and a map poster describing their conservation efforts and projects  within their organization at the Environment Showcase at the ESRI User  Conference and at the SCGIS conference.</p>
            <p>        b)   be available to volunteer to help with the  SCGIS conference and the Environment Showcase at the  ESRI User Conference. The volunteer help may include helping setup/teardown  of the Hall, running SCGIS membership booth. We expect recipients to volunteer  for approximately 4 hours over the course of the conference.  Some work may take place during sessions, but  adjustments can be made to ensure that volunteers attend the sessions that are  most important to them.  Details for  volunteers will be provided shortly before the conference.</p>
            <p>         c)   attend the scheduled training classes, and come prepared to work on your  specific GIS project during the training. You will need to bring your GIS data  and any other raw data you need to incorporate in your project. Please also see  details in the Instructions below.</p>
            <p>         d)   be available  for other scholarship support activities in the  evenings and weekends.</p>
            <p>        e)   complete and  submit 2 reports:<br>
              1.  Scholar's report is an informal account of  your experiences as a scholar and is due towards the end of your travels.<br>
              2.  Scholarship Final report is a formal account  of your work back home and is due a few months after you return home.  It describes how you have applied the  training, software and other items of your grant, with example maps and photos,  and specific suggestions and criticisms for improving the program.  Specific requirements and due dates are finalized  later.</p>
            <p>        f)   read and respond quickly to  many emails.  There will be about 20  emails from us with important announcements that you are required to read and  respond to.  Failure to do so in a prompt  manner can result in the disruption or even loss of portions of your grant.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== SCGIS  OBLIGATIONS TO YOU IF SELECTED AS A SCHOLAR</strong></p>
            <p>You will receive a combination of fee waivers, travel  expenses and in-kind grants that can be worth over $10,000. The specific  components of this grant are:</p>
            <p>        a)  Tuition fees for GIS training (retail value $490 per person per day) are FULLY covered</p>
            <p>        b)  Attendance fees for the ESRI User Conference ($1,395) and for SCGIS Annual  Conference ($130) are FULLY covered</p>
            <p>        c)  Travel expenses are PARTIALLY covered, depending on your grant level, beginning  when you leave to attend the program and ending when you return home from the  program, including the following categories of costs: Lodging, Food, Air and Ground  Transport. Each grantee's allocation will be different and many factors will go  into determining the grant for each scholar.</p>
            <p>        d)  Travel preparation expenses are NOT covered, including fees or travel expenses  you must pay locally to obtain Visas or pick up air tickets. </p>
            <p>        e) Software  and Textbooks grant:  As a scholar you  will be encouraged to apply for a customized grant of software and textbooks  through a separate application process described at <a href="http://www.conservationgis.org/grant">http://www.conservationgis.org/grant</a> . You will receive details about this if you are selected.</p>
            <p><strong>*=== GENERAL APPLICATION  INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
            <p>Please review above the list of materials that are expected from you. Of  course, properly and thoughtfully submitted application form is the essential part  of the list, but the other parts are also important! Applications submitted  without the other required materials may be rejected, or will stand a much  lower chance of award.</p>
            <p>Before filling out the application form, please read the section-by-section  instructions below, and think carefully about the overall structure of your  application. </p>
            <p>Although the SCGIS Scholarship Program is not a typical scholarship  program, some general guidelines found at <a href="http://www.scholarshiphelp.org/preparing_application.htm">http://www.scholarshiphelp.org/preparing_application.htm</a> can help you in writing your application to SCGIS. The web site above is  designed primarily to help apply for college scholarships, so not everything on  that page is applicable to SCGIS Scholarship Program, however, there are a few  useful hints that will be helpful. This web link is not affiliated with SCGIS, and is  provided as a resource that you can use under your own guidance.</p>
            <p>Please DO NOT ERASE ANY OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE APPLICATION FORM. If a  question is not applicable to you, just leave the answer area blank.</p>
            <p>You will see that many sections are labeled in the instructions as ‘very  important’, and it’s true – we really need detailed and thoughtful answers to  most questions we are asking. The competition for SCGIS scholarships is very  tight, and if you limit your answers to short general phrases, this will reduce  your chances of winning a scholarship award.</p>
            <p>Please write your application in the English language. Although some of  our review committee members speak other languages, we’ll be able to judge your  application more fairly if it is written in English. Remember, if you are  awarded a scholarship you will join a group of people from all corners of the  world, and in such situations English is usually the common language. Also, the  training and conferences are all conducted in English, but technical GIS English  is less demanding and few of your colleagues will be fluent, so your English  skills do not have to be brilliant and shiny. This is not our criteria,  so please do not be shy if your English is not perfect! You will find a way to  communicate with others!</p>
            <p>As indicated above, part of the  application process is your ability to pay some of the costs.   It is important for the applicants to make  a very strong effort to supply as much of their own funding for travel to the  conference as possible. Preference will be given to those who make a sincere  effort to obtain some of their own funding.   Accordingly, the applicant must supply information about additional  funding they have been able to or hope to secure.  If you cannot pay  anything, you will need to provide strong evidence about the financial circumstances  of yourself, your institution, your country.   Each year we do make some grants to scholars who are unable to  contribute anything, but the majority of the grants we make go to applicants who  are able to contribute an amount that is appropriate and sustainable given  their financial circumstances.  </p>
            <p>When you commit in your application to contribute an  amount it is a serious commitment and if you are selected as a scholar we  expect you to honor that commitment to pay.   If you cannot, and you have not been in regular communication with us  about your circumstances, then parts of your grant will be declined.</p>
            <p>If you have to use abbreviations in your application,  such as names of organizations or projects, please clearly decipher these abbreviations  before using them. Also, if you are referring to any local landmarks (a mountain  name, a region name, a park name etc.), please provide a brief explanation of  significance of such landmarks. Remember, your application will be reviewed by  experts working in many different parts of the world, and an abbreviation or  landmark that are a routine part of your daily work may not sound so familiar  to a person living on the other side of the globe!</p>
            <p>If you need more explanations or help in understanding  the form, please contact the local SCGIS Chapter or conservation GIS community  leaders.</p>

            <p><strong>[APPLICANT]<br>
*-Your full name: <br>
*-Your honorific (e.g. Mr., Ms., Dr.): <br>
*-Your preferred informal name: <br>
*-Your direct address if different:<br>
*-Your direct phone number(s): <br>
*-Your direct email address(es): <br>
*-Your job title or role in the organization:<br>
*-Your own interest keywords (please see  instructions): </strong></p>
            <p>Please provide your personal information similarly to the organization  information. </p>
            <p>You can provide your full name to any extent that you find appropriate.  The format is completely flexible, and it does not have to be exactly ‘full’ in  official terms. The diversity of naming traditions in the world is amazing, and  the order people use for family names and given names, the number of names, the  names pronunciation, the name that is actually used in the society to refer to  a person – all these can be different in different cultures on different  continents, and we respect your right to represent yourself by the name (or the  form of your name) that is most comfortable for you.  SCGIS activists are constantly learning about  these traditions from meeting international scholars, however, there is always  something new for us to learn. Please be understanding if we misinterpret your  name by accident – we do not mean any offence. You can help us better understand  you if you provide your preferred “informal” name for cases where using full  name is unnecessary. The format for the “informal” name is completely open to  your choice. You may leave this field blank if you want.</p>
            <p>For your interest keywords, please use the list of keywords above (see  ORGANIZATION section), plus any missing keywords that you would like to  include.</p>
            <p>This information may be shared to a third party only if we ask for and  receive your special permission.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Alternate contact full name:<br>
*-Alternate honorific (i.e. Mr., Ms., Dr.):<br>
*-Alternate contact direct phone number(s):<br>
*-Alternate contact direct email address(es):<br>
*-Alternate contact job title or role:</strong></p>
			  <p>Please provide contact details for an alternate contact person. We may  ask this person to convey important information to you when you are in the  field or out of contact for some other reason. These contact details will not  be used for any other purpose, and will not be shared with any third party.</p>
			  <p><strong>[TRANSPORTATION]<br>
			    *-Your departure airport to travel to the U.S.:</strong></p>
			  <p>Please let us know what airport you will be flying from if you travel to  California, USA (the FIRST airport in your entire  trip). This helps us better understand your actual travel needs. If possible,  please provide the 3-letter international code for your airport.</p>
			  <p><strong>*- Total ROUNDTRIP airfare in U.S. dollars:</strong></p>
			  <p>This year different parts of our program will be located  in two distinct geographical areas: the training part will be organized in Davis in Northern California, while the conferences will  be held in Southern California. If you are  selected as a scholar SCGIS will arrange and cover transportation between these  two locations, but you should know that there is a great distance between these  two areas that takes a full day of travel, therefore, to simplify your overall travel,  we encourage you to research on itineraries with arrival in one of the airports  near Davis, and with departure from the Los Angeles area. However, as multi-leg  airfares with different arrival and departure airports can sometimes be  considerably more expensive than simple roundtrip options, please also research  on itineraries with both arrival in and departure from airports near Davis.</p>
			  <p>Davis is a part of the large  metropolitan area called San Francisco Bay Area where there are several  airports within reasonable distance from Davis:  San Francisco International (SFO), Oakland International (OAK), and  Sacramento Metropolitan (SMF). It is very  typical for big urban areas in the U.S. to have several airports, that  is why we are asking you to research on different options.  Sacramento (SMF) is the nearest airport to Davis, and will be the  most convenient to arrive in. The next best choice is Oakland airport (OAK). However, neither SMF  nor OAK is the largest airport in the area, and actually these may not be  available for international flights. If this is the case, please research for  airfares to San Francisco (SFO). Besides availability, airfares to the larger SFO  may be significantly cheaper than to smaller airports, so please research all  possible options. Not only this will allow you to identify the most  cost-efficient way, but will also provide you with back-up options in case you  have to re-arrange your plans.</p>
			  <p>Redlands will be the  hub for closing events of the program (SCIGIS Annual Conference and some  post-conference activities). Redlands  is a part of Greater Los Angeles area that also has a choice of several  airports. The nearest and the most convenient airport is Ontario, California  (ONT), however, the biggest airport in the area is Los Angeles International  (LAX). Another small airport worth considering is John Wayne/Orange County  airport in Santa Ana (SNA).</p>
			  <p>International airfares are not cheap, but please research for reasonable  economy class options. SCGIS will not fund first-class or business-class  travel. Sometimes opting for a 1 stopover or 2 stopover flight might save you a  significant amount of money compared to a non-stop direct flight. On the other  hand, sometimes non-stop flights on a smaller airline are cheaper than flights with  stopovers on a major international carrier. Traveling on a weekday is often cheaper  than traveling during weekend.</p>
			  <p>We ask that you provide cost estimates for as many itinerary options as  reasonably possible, including at least one option to arrive in the Bay Area  and to leave from Los Angeles  area, and at least one option to arrive and to leave using the same airport in  the Bay Area. A demonstrated effort in trying to optimize the travel costs will  be taken into consideration when we select the scholarship awardees.</p>
			  <p>Please use June 23-26 as the arrival dates in California, and July 21-23 as the departure  dates in your research; if these specific dates are currently unavailable for  booking, please use the nearest possible dates.<br>
			    <br>
			    Please provide all airfares for a <strong>ROUNDTRIP</strong>,  and in the <strong>U.S. Dollars</strong>, <strong>not </strong>in your local currency.</p>
			  <p>If you have to bear significant costs for traveling to the nearest  airport, please indicate these costs separately in this section, too.</p>
			  <p><strong>*-Airfare amount you can pay yourself (in U.S.  Dollars): <br>
*-Airfare amount requested from SCGIS (in U.S.  Dollars):</strong></p>
			  <p>Typically we expect our applicants to cover a part of their travel  costs, through additional fundraising or other resources. In very rare cases we  provide a full airfare, but to be eligible you must provide a thorough  explanation in the justification section (below). We really appreciate every  effort you make to cover at least some portion of the costs. In these two  lines, please indicate (in U.S. Dollars) what part of the airfare costs you are  able to cover, and what part you would like SCGIS to cover.</p>
            <p><strong>[ACCOMMODATION]<br />
*-Accommodation/Food/Local Transport costs that you can  pay (in U.S. Dollars):</strong></p>
            <p>If you are awarded a SCGIS scholarship, you will spend 4 weeks in the U.S.  Typically, this may cost over $5,000. SCGIS  volunteers work hard to reduce costs through finding discounts, ride sharing,  cooking options etc. This allows us to reduce these per person costs to $2,000  on average. However, we greatly appreciate it when scholars are able to raise  funds to cover a portion of these costs. Please indicate how much you can  afford to pay for these expenses.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Will you share a private home? <br />
*-Will you share a motel room?  <br />
*-Will you camp? <br />
*-Do you need to borrow camping equipment?</strong></p>
            <p>One of the ways for us to reduce lodging costs is to provide  accommodation at SCGIS activists’ homes, sharing hotel and dorm rooms, or  sometimes even tents where conditions permit. Please let us know your  accommodation preference/flexibility. If you can bring your own sleeping bag  and pad, please also indicate here.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Any special notes regarding Accommodation/Food/Local Transport in California:</strong></p>
            <p>If you have any health or other conditions that require special food or  lodging please let us know (this will not influence our award decision, but  will help us better plan logistics for the group). Also, please feel free to  tell us anything regarding local accommodation or food or transport  arrangements in California  that you think we should know about.</p>
            <p><strong>[GIS EXPERTISE LEVEL / COURSES]<br />
              *-Briefly describe your GIS capability/expertise:</strong></p>
            <p>Please briefly explain your GIS expertise / capability level - BEGINNER,  MEDIUM or ADVANCED. Please feel free to comment in open format.</p>
            <p>BEGINNER - Know about basic concepts of GIS and have used ArcExplorer,  web-based mapping resources, or similar level of GIS software.<br>
              MEDIUM - Know about the analysis concepts of GIS and have used ArcView  3x/9x/10 or similar level of GIS software.<br>
              ADVANCED - Have been a GIS user for many years and have used ArcEditor  or ArcInfo or similar level of GIS software.</p>
            <p><strong>*-What GIS software (if any) have you used?:</strong></p>
            <p> Please provide details on what GIS software have you used, and briefly  describe operations that you have implemented in your GIS work.</p>
            <p><strong>*-Please describe your programming experience (if  any):</strong></p>
            <p>Please note that knowledge of programming is not necessary for using  GIS. However, today’s GIS software products allow users to extend the  functionality through writing scripts in programming languages such as Visual  Basic, Python, C++, etc. If you have any programming experience, please  mention, this will help us to better understand your level of skills.</p>
            <p><strong>*-What organization or individual helps you learn GIS  (your mentor)?<br />
*-Your mentor’s email address: <br />
*-Your mentor’s phone number:</strong></p>
            <p>Learning GIS is challenging! There are advanced international groups or  individuals who support developing grass-root organizations in building GIS  capacity through providing software, hardware, training, and general mentorship  until the GIS program reaches maturity in the organization. If you have such a  mentor, please give us their contact details. We may contact the mentor to  better learn about your GIS program. We will not use the contact information in  any other way.</p>
            <p><strong>*-What GIS training are you interested in? (PLEASE SEE  INSTRUCTIONS!):<a name="courses" id="courses"></a></strong></p>
            <p>In a free essay form, please share with us your thoughts on the  directions in which you would like to develop your GIS skills. Feel free to  explain what difficulties you have encountered in your GIS work so far, what  knowledge you think you’re missing to progress in GIS, and anything else  concerning your GIS training needs. You can be as general or as specific as you  want, but remember that more detailed and focused explanations will help us  better tailor the training program to your specific needs.</p>
            <p>The proposed course will teach core and advanced GIS skills based on  courses developed by the company Juniper GIS. All the materials and project  scenarios in the class revolve around conservation themes and data. There will  also be a very strong emphasis on students’ individual projects. We’ve found in  the past that the real learning comes when you apply the classroom lessons to  your own projects, because with GIS, each project is unique.</p>
            <p>All the students will go through the same program, so there is a common  base. Advanced students will be expected to do all the exercises, but they will  also be expected to help the less experienced students and to tackle more  advanced projects.  This is similar to  taking a dual-level course in college where both undergrads and grad students  take the same course, but more is expected of the graduate students.</p>
            <p>There will be 3 instructors for the course, meaning that there will be  plenty of support, and plenty of help for individual projects.</p>
            <p>The course will be taught in a “GIS Camp” format. What we mean by this  is that while there will be a sort of regular schedule, we don’t expect  learning to stop at the end of the day, or only be confined to the classroom.  In past years, much of the learning came from student and instructor  interactions outside the formal classroom structure. The first week and a half  will be more structured, but after that, more emphasis will be put on scholars’  projects, with time to work on presentations.</p>
            <p>The course will probably finish with working through the book,  “Conservation Planning from the bottom up: <a href="http://www.conservationgis.org/publications/ConsPlanningBook.html">http://www.conservationgis.org/publications/ConsPlanningBook.html</a> . This book is currently in draft mode, but we hope to incorporate this as a  final project into the course, but based on planning for your conservation  project.</p>
            <p>Course Modules:<br>
              The training will be based on the courses listed below from Juniper GIS and  will be taught using ArcGIS&nbsp;10. Descriptions can be found at: <a href="http://www.junipergis.com/training/class-descriptions/">http://www.junipergis.com/training/class-descriptions/</a> . Students will receive certificates for these courses that qualify for GISP  certification - <a href="http://www.gisci.org/">http://www.gisci.org/</a> .This  is the material that was used successfully at last year’s training and has been  taught to hundreds of students. </p>
            <p>Working with ArcGIS for Natural Resources – 3 days<br>
              Introduction to Spatial Analyst for ArcGIS – 2 days<br>
              Working with Geodatabases and Linear Referencing – 2 days<br>
              Advanced ArcGIS: Productivity, Geoprocessing, and Analysis – 2 days.<br>
              Working with GPS – 1 day </p>
            <p>After scholars have been accepted, we will modify or add onto these  courses to try to meet everyone’s needs. </p>
            <p>Student Projects:<br>
              <strong>This is a very important part of the  course. </strong>Scholars are requested to bring any current or planned projects and  data with them, and to provide an outline of the project, any problems, data  needs, questions and expected outcomes in advance. Then the instructors can  start working with scholars on these projects.   If you are new to GIS and don’t have a project, ask your organization  what they need. The more you can tell us about your needs, the better we can  focus the course for you. The goal is that at the end of this time scholars  will have a completed or well-started project so they can really have something  solid as a result.</p>
            <p>If you  have a GPS unit and need help in learning how to use it, please feel free to  bring it as well, as one of our instructors will be able to provide a  professional consultancy on this.</p>

*-Essay justification of why you require a grant:</strong></p>
            <p>This is a VERY IMPORTANT section! Please explain us why you would like  to join the SCGIS training and attend the conferences, and why you need a  scholarship grant for that. Justification cannot be as short as “I need to  improve my skills, and I can’t afford the trip”. We need to know in detail why  you need new contacts, new skills and so on, and a detailed justification why  you are asking for financial assistance.</p>
            <p><strong>[REQUIRED PAPER that you will present at the  conference]<br>

If selected as a scholar, you  will be contacted by the papers coordinator for details about your paper (final  title and abstract text, full list of authors, etc.). </p>
            <p><strong>[REQUIRED BACKGROUND DATA]<a name="background" id="background"></a></strong></p>
            <p>This is a VERY IMPORTANT section! In the following sub-sections, please  try to be as detailed as possible. Remember, we can only make an award decision  if we clearly understand the role that your organization and you play in the  field of conservation, and if we understand the role of the GIS component in  your work!</p>
            <p>It’s not uncommon for applicants to use abbreviations and landmark names  in these sections – please remember to explain these carefully, as suggested in  the General Application Instructions.</p>
            <p><strong>*-HISTORY: Please describe the history of your local  work in conservation and GIS:</strong></p>
            <p>It’s important for us to know the history of your work – your personal  history of involvement in conservation, or your organization’s history and your  role in the organization’s projects.</p>
            <p>Please  do not hesitate to explain how long you have been involved in conservation and  GIS, what projects or actions you have worked in, your motivation for working  in conservation, and anything else that you think is relevant here.</p>
            <p><strong>*-LOCAL INVOLVEMENT: Please describe how you work in  your local conservation and GIS community:</strong></p>
            <p>If you and your organization work with other local  NGO's or institutions, please elaborate and please provide full contact  information for at least one of them.</p>
            <p>Besides, please explain how you cooperate with the local SCGIS Chapter  or conservation GIS community in your region.</p>

            <p><strong>*-UNIQUE:   Please describe what is the most unique and the most challenging about  the conservation/GIS work that you do:</strong></p>
            <p>In this section, please tell us about the most exciting and the most  difficult parts of your work. You can tell us about the obstacles you’re having  in running your GIS projects. Also, please tell us anything you want about  uniqueness of the area where you work – remember, your reviewers may not be  aware about the beauty of the region you are from, and about the threats to  this region!</p>
            <p><strong>*-PLAN: Please provide a 1-year plan for how you hope  to apply the skills you will learn under the SCGIS scholarship, and what you  expect to be able to achieve in your conservation GIS work over the next year:</strong></p>
            <p>This is a very important part! Your plan for future work is the key for  application reviewers to know what outreach the SCGIS Scholarship Program may  expect, and what research or action the Scholarship Program is going to be  contributing to. You are not restricted to one year, please feel free to provide  a longer term plan if you can.</p>
            <p>Please  note that we are not only interested in your plan for the conservation project  you are working on, but also on how you plan to be involved in the local SCGIS  Chapter or conservation GIS community.            </p>
            <p><strong>[RETURNING SCHOLAR STATUS REPORT]<br>
*-RETURNING SCHOLARS: Please provide a report about  your progress and achievements since your last visit:</strong></p>
            <p>If you received the SCGIS Scholarship Award before, please fill in this  section, otherwise skip.<br>
Our requirements to returning scholars are stricter compared to  first-time applicants. We need a strong justification to provide an award to  somebody who received it before. Please use this section to tell us about your  work since your last visit. While, of course, we would like to see certain  progress and achievements, please do not hesitate to tell us about difficulties  that may have prevented you from accomplishing something. We need to know about  your problems to understand your need for help! </p>
            <p>Please remember that the scholarship applications are reviewed by a panel  of reviewers, and even though you might have updated some members of the SCGIS  International Program, it is a good idea to use this section to provide a  detailed report for the reviewers who are not familiar with your work.</p>
