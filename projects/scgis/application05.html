            <p class="text"><strong>Please note that the deadline for application submittions has been extended to February 15th, 2005.</strong></p>
            <p class="text"> The Society for Conservation GIS (<a href="http://www.scgis.org">SCGIS</a>) would like
              to invite you to join us for GIS software trainings, the Eighth Annual SCGIS
              Conference, to be held from July 31 - August 2, 2005 at Monterey, California
              (USA) and the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) User
              Conference at San Diego, California (USA) from July 25-29th, 2005.</p>
            <p class="text"> GIS Trainings, which will occur prior to and following the SCGIS Conference,
              will be focused on the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) suite
              of GIS software. The conference will provide a venue to discuss and promote
              local and global conservation of natural and cultural resources through
              geospatial technologies as well as provide a venue to establish long lasting
              and productive partnerships with fellow conservationists. We are busy
              designing a diverse conference agenda that will explore a variety of issues
              ranging from the technical applications of GIS in conservation to recurring
              philosophical and ethical issues faced by conservationists throughout the
              world. We will also address the role of the Society in the development of
              the global Conservation Community.</p>
            <p class="text"> Conservation GIS users who require financial assistance to enable them to attend the Conferences and GIS trainings can apply for limited, competitive
              scholarships following the steps below. Scholarship funds will cover partial
              airfare, and waivers for SCGIS and ESRI User conference registration fees,
              as well as tuition for the pre and post conference GIS trainings. This
              year's training curriculum will be dictated by the skill-level of accepted
              applicants. All efforts will be made to accommodate your specific training
              needs.</p>
